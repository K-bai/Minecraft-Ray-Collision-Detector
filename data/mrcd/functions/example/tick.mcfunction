# Summon each diferent ray. In this example, we use the player as a reference for where and towards where the ray will go
# We use some simple math (two points subtraction) to eassily calculate the motion

# If we whant a ray that will travel a distance over time (ticks), we set that distance and call ray_tick each tick
# For example we whant a ray taht travels 10b/s = 10b/20t = 0.5b/t and then end. (b = blocks, s = seconds, t = ray_tick call)
# To do this we summon an area_effect_cloud that lasts 10 ticks (Duration tag) = 0.5 /t *10 t = 5b/10 t = 10b/20t = 10b/s
