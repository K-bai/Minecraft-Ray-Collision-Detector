# summon each diferent ray. In this example, we use the player as a reference for where and towards where the ray will go.
# So, we use oriented relative coordinates and some math to eassily assing the speed (this case, 0.5 b/ray_tick).
# Since the summoned area_effect_cloud lasts for 10 ticks (Duration), it will travel at max 5 blocks
